# React + TypeScript + Vite Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), TypeScript, SCSS, BEM methodology for styling, and React Router for client-side routing.

### Technologies Used:
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript to catch errors early.
- **Vite**: Next-generation front-end tool that offers fast build and development times.
- **React Router**: A routing library to handle navigation in single-page applications.
- **SCSS**: CSS preprocessor for writing styles more efficiently.
- **BEM (Block Element Modifier)**: A methodology for writing clean and reusable CSS.
- **ESLint**: Linting tool to ensure code quality and consistency.
